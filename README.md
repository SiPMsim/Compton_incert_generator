This code generates by Monte Carlo Compton angle uncertainties as a function of detector energy resolution for a Compton camera, incorporating Doppler broadening effects. It can be used to produce tabulated data, offering a more reliable alternative to analytical formulas that tend to fail at low and high Compton angles.
